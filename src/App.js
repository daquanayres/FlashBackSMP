          <h3 className="Questions">What is Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP)?</h3>
          <p>
            Scalp Micropigmentation is a non-surgical technique of implanting
            organic plant-based pigment deposits through the dermal layer of the
            scalp. The pigment deposits imitate hair follicles and produce the
            presence of a complete head of hair. If you aren’t fulfilled from
            hair transplant results and necessitate more density or you would
            just like to add density to specific zones of your scalp where
            you’ve noticed thinning hair or balding, SMP is great option for
            you.For those individuals that are bald entirely, SMP provides a 5
            o’clock shadow style. SMP is meant for you.

          <h3 className="Questions">How bad is the pain?</h3>
          <p>
            Scale 1-10. It should be between 2-4. 2 being the softest and 4 way
            too much. Traditional tattoos pain falls in between a 4-10. So the
            agony is not as intense. Pain tolerance does vary between client so
            prioritize your health and safety. During the procedure, you’ll be
            asked to rate the pain level from time to time to ensure your
            treatment is as therapeutic as possible.

        <div className="FAQS1">
          <h3 className="Questions">How long are treatments?</h3>
          <p>
            Each session is between 2-3 hours with a 10-minute break each hour
            for stretching and/or a quick snack. The first treatment is
            characteristically the lengthiest as we are restructuring the
            hairline and applying the introductory layer. Each following
            treatment is typically shorter, although this can vary based on
            maintenance after the previous treatments.

        </div>
        <div className="FAQS2">
          <h3 className="Questions">How many treatments would I need?</h3>
          <p>
            Scalp Micropigmentation is done in a minimum of three treatments.
            Treatments 7-10 days apart to allow your skin (the largest organ on
            the body) to accept the procedure; the human skin will reject about
            30% of the pigment immediately after the first treatment. We expect
            to see great results after the first treatment but after the second
            treatment you will realize an substantial outcome in its depth, and
            you’ll be closer to your desired goal. There is a possibility of a
            fourth or fifth treatment 1-3 months after the 3rd treatment where
            we add the finishing touches if you were completely bald or wish for
            more density.

          <h3 className="Questions">
            Can I decide on the recreation of my hairline?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are several factors that limit what hairline is suitable for
            you. We alter the hairline to your unique features in order to form
            the most natural and suitable result. Your preferences are also
            accounted for in the selection process. There are 3 types of
            hairlines (Straight line, Natural/Slight Receding, and the Round
            Hairline) to choose from.

          <h3 className="Questions">
            Do I need to cut my hair before the SMP treatment?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the stage of hair loss; we require our patients to cut
            their hair to the lowest length that they plan to maintain after the
            treatment. If you forger, it’s not the end of the world. We keep a
            professional set of clippers and razors for these circumstances. If
            your hair loss is at a higher number on the Norwood 7 stage hair
            loss scale, we recommend not shaving completely bald as it would
            make it the difficult to see where your original hairline was.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Nope, SMP is non-invasive and non-surgical procedure. You’ll only
            need to worry about following our one-week aftercare instructions.

        <div className="FAQS2">
          <h3 className="Questions">How long does the SMP results last?</h3>
          <p>
            We understand our clients want to stay fresh out clients should
            expect touch ups within the 5-7 years. SMP is permanent procedure
            which will last forever, but as we shed our skin cells, and age,
            overtime wear and tear can occur on the surface of the skin which
            causing it to appear less dense.

            Your Scalp Micropigmentation was strategically created by a
            professional Artist who ensures top quality and the rest is up to

            <ol>
              <li>
                I strongly recommend no working out, no heavy washing, no
                haircuts, and limited to no touching of the scalp for the first
                week.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wash SMP area with clean hands, warm water and liquid
                anti-bacterial soap (do not use bar soap)
              </li>
              <li>
                You may pat your scalp dry with a clean paper towel or let it
                air dry.
              </li>
              <li>
                Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment (Aquaphor, Neosporin,
                etc.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reiteration this method morning and night or after any time your
                tattoo is exposed to dirt, substantial amount of sweat or any
                outside elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                No swimming, soaking or direct sun exposure for at least 2
                weeks.
              </li>
              <li>Don’t wear hats or items that can tub the pigment.</li>
              <li>No picking or scratching.</li>
            </ol>
            Follow instructions for max healing results. Please call your artist
            if you have any questions. Any deviance from this healing method

          <h3 className="Questions">
            Will shaving my head daily affect my treatment?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No; In fact, most clients shave daily. The treatment penetrates the
            skin under the surface of the dermis.

            Will individuals notice I’ve had the procedure done?
          </h3>
          <p>
            During the healing process, you’ll have some redness for about 72
            hours. The pigment will take a few days to fade 30-35% to appear
            more natural. The remaining treatments will add more density to
            improve the look.

            Will have more hairstyles to choose from V.S. the shaved look?
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's important to understand that SMP gives the illusion of hair
            follicles and does not give it 3D texture. The hairstyle choice
            selected is best compared to the Norwood 7 stage hair loss scale.
            We’ll gauge your hair loss during the consultation. A lower number
            means you have hair use to blend the treatment with. This is called
            a filler treatment. The higher the number, we recommend keeping the
            hair to shaved for the best look due to the area covered with the
            treatment.

        <div className="FAQS1">
          <h3 className="Questions">How much will my procedure cost?</h3>
          <p>

            $3500-$5500.We offer our treatments at a very competitive rate. Our
