              Scalp Micropigmentation is a non-surgical technique of implanting
              organic plant-based pigment deposits through the dermal layer of
              the scalp. The pigment deposits imitate hair follicles and produce
              the presence of a complete head of hair. If you aren’t fulfilled
              from hair transplant results and necessitate more density or you
              would just like to add density to specific zones of your scalp
              where you’ve noticed thinning hair or balding, SMP is great option
              for you.For those individuals that are bald entirely, SMP provides
              a 5 o’clock shadow style. SMP is meant for you.

              Each session is between 2-3 hours with a 10-minute break each hour
              for stretching and/or a quick snack. The first treatment is
              characteristically the lengthiest as we are restructuring the
              hairline and applying the introductory layer. Each following
              treatment is typically shorter, although this can vary based on
              maintenance after the previous treatments.

              Scalp Micropigmentation is done in a minimum of three treatments.
              Treatments 7-10 days apart to allow your skin (the largest organ
              on the body) to accept the procedure; the human skin will reject
              about 30% of the pigment immediately after the first treatment. We
              expect to see great results after the first treatment but after
              the second treatment you will realize an substantial outcome in
              its depth, and you’ll be closer to your desired goal. There is a
              possibility of a fourth or fifth treatment 1-3 months after the
              3rd treatment where we add the finishing touches if you were
              completely bald or wish for more density.

              cut their hair to the lowest length that they plan to maintain
              after the treatment. If you forger, it’s not the end of the world.
              We keep a professional set of clippers and razors for these
              circumstances. If your hair loss is at a higher number on the
              Norwood 7 stage hair loss scale, we recommend not shaving
              completely bald as it would make it the difficult to see where
              your original hairline was.

              We understand our clients want to stay fresh out clients should
              expect touch ups within the 5-7 years. SMP is permanent procedure
              which will last forever, but as we shed our skin cells, and age,
              overtime wear and tear can occur on the surface of the skin which
              causing it to appear less dense.

              No; In fact, most clients shave daily. The treatment penetrates

              During the healing process, you’ll have some redness for about 72
              hours. The pigment will take a few days to fade 30-35% to appear
              more natural. The remaining treatments will add more density to

              It's important to understand that SMP gives the illusion of hair
              follicles and does not give it 3D texture. The hairstyle choice
              selected is best compared to the Norwood 7 stage hair loss scale.
              We’ll gauge your hair loss during the consultation. A lower number
              means you have hair use to blend the treatment with. This is
              called a filler treatment. The higher the number, we recommend
              keeping the hair shaved for the best look due to the area covered
              by the treatment.
